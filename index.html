        <h2> Summary </h2>
            <p> I am a dedicated and organised worker and I am always striving to push myself 
                beyond my previous limitations. I include myself in activities centered around 
                both music and drama, allowing me to speak infront of large gatherings of 
                people with confidence. My aim is to pursue a career in music production 
                and performance which I am working towards by continually recording and 
                producing both original and cover pieces to grow my portfolio.
